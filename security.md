# Security Policy

At JTorLeon Studios, we prioritize security. Our dependencies are regularly scanned using tools to notify us of any 
potential vulnerabilities in new versions. Additionally, we keep our use of external dependencies to a minimum, with 
our compiled code relying almost exclusively on those already present in the Minecraft environmentâ€”the game itself, 
its core dependencies, and components added by mod loaders.

### User Responsibilities

- Report any vulnerabilities found as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

## Notes

- Vulnerabilities in the dependencies (e.g., minecraft, forge, fabric, neoforge, etc.) should be reported directly to 
  their maintainers.
